HW1: git and GitHub
===================

The file [`data/roster.tsv`](data/roster.tsv) is a *tab-separated-values* (TSV)
file, so called because each column is separated by a tab (`\t`) character. Each
row represents a single student; the columns are as follows:

-   GitHub username
-   Email address (ideally, the one that matches up with your CUNYfirst one)
-   (Optional; not mandatory) your preferred pronouns, or blank

Your assignment is to add a row to this file with your information by issuing a
pull request using the fork-and-pull model. Your pull request should otherwise
preserve the integrity of the roster; i.e., it should not delete other students'
entries or add extraneous information.

You *must* make your pull request from a non-master branch of your fork.

Once you see that your pull request has been accepted, you are done with the
assignment.

Hints
-----

-   If you're leaving the third field blank, you should still have a tab after
    the second column. That way, there are three columns on all lines.
-   Make sure you look at the file as it appears on GitHub. If it does not
    appear as you want it to, change it, commit, and push; this second commit
    will automatically become part of your pull request.
